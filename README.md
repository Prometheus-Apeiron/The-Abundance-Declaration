## About

The Abundance Declaration argues that humanity has solved scarcity but not distribution. We have the resources, technology, and knowledge to provide abundance for all; yet artificial scarcity persists through institutional design.

This document presents a framework for transitioning from scarcity-based to abundance-based systems.
