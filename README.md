## About

The Abundance Declaration is a vision for reimagining human flourishing through the advancement of new economic and political foundations in this age of increasing abundance. 

The core argument: humanity has solved scarcity but not distribution. We have the resources, technology, and knowledge to provide abundance for all; yet artificial scarcity persists through institutional design.
